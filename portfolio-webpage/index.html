          <h2><em>About Me</em></h2>
          <p>
            After several years working in HR, I decided to pursue my passion
            for coding and made the switch to software engineering. I've since
            developed a strong skill set in several programming languages,
            including Ruby, JavaScript, and Java, which I use to design and
            implement effective and user-friendly software solutions. I'm
            passionate about staying up-to-date with the latest trends and
            technologies in the industry, and I'm always seeking new challenges
            to help me grow and improve as a software engineer.

          <h2><em>Past Experiences</em></h2>
          <p>
            As a Junior Developer at Pensano Devs, I had the opportunity to work
            on a variety of challenging and exciting projects. I gained valuable
            experience in Ruby and JavaScript, and had the chance to collaborate
            closely with senior developers to contribute to the development of
            complex software solutions. One of my most memorable projects was a
            web application that I worked on with a team of other developers - I
            was responsible for designing and implementing several key features,
            and I learned a lot from the feedback and guidance of my colleagues.
            Working at Pensano Devs helped me develop my technical skills and
            taught me the importance of collaboration and communication in a
            fast-paced, dynamic work environment.
          </p>
          <p>
            Before that, I worked 2 years as an HR Manager at HR Global. I was
            responsible for overseeing all aspects of HR operations, from
            recruitment and onboarding to performance management and employee
            relations. I led a team of HR professionals and worked closely with
            leadership to align HR strategy with the broader goals of the
            organization. One of my proudest achievements in this role was
            implementing a new employee development program that helped to
            improve retention and engagement across the organization. I also
            enjoyed working on diversity and inclusion initiatives, and was
            pleased to see the positive impact they had on employee morale and
            overall company culture. Working in HR taught me the importance of
            balancing the needs of individuals with the needs of the
            organization, and gave me a deep appreciation for the human side of
            the workplace.

          <h2><em>Hobbies</em></h2>
          <p>
            Gaming: As a software engineer, I'm naturally drawn to the world of
            technology, and one of my favorite ways to explore it is through
            gaming. I love the immersive worlds, intricate storylines, and
            challenging puzzles that video games offer. But beyond that, I also
            appreciate the social aspect of gaming - whether I'm playing with
            friends or participating in an online community, there's always the
            opportunity to connect with other like-minded individuals and share
            experiences. For me, gaming is a way to unwind, stimulate my mind,
            and connect with others, all at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reading: When I'm not coding or gaming, you can often find me curled
            up with a good book. I've always been a bookworm, and I find that
            reading is a great way to relax and escape into other worlds and
            perspectives. Whether I'm delving into a gripping thriller or
            immersing myself in a thought-provoking work of non-fiction, I
            always come away from my reading with new insights and ideas.
            Reading also helps me stay sharp and informed about developments in
            the world of technology and beyond, which is essential in my work as
            a software engineer.
